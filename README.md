# 🏥 Patient Information Management System (PIMS)

PIMS is a complete web-based healthcare management solution designed for hospitals to streamline appointment scheduling, doctor-patient interactions, nurse coordination, and report tracking — all while ensuring role-based access and data security.

## 🚀 Features
### 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor Panel
- Register or log in with a hospital ID.
- Create and manage a hospital profile.
- View and manage verified appointments.
- Add prescriptions, checkup outcomes, and suggestions post-consultation.

### 🧑‍⚕️ Nurse Panel
- Login with credentials generated by a doctor.
- Add new patients using email & hospital ID.
- Approve or reject appointment requests based on doctor availability.
- Verify doctor-submitted reports.
- View only hospital-specific patient data.

### 🧑 Patient Portal
- Register and login independently (no hospital ID required).
- Book appointments with basic symptoms.
- Receive reminders post-appointment.
- View medical history, prescriptions, and reports.

## 🔐 Authentication & Roles

- **Doctors**: Hospital/Department-based login.
- **Nurses**: Login credentials are generated by doctors (not self-registered).
- **Patients**: Simple independent registration.


## 🗃️ Database Structure

The project uses a MySQL database with multiple interrelated tables:

- `appointments`
- `approval`
- `visit`
- `report`
- `departments`
- `doctors`
- `nurses`
- `user_details` (Patient)
- `hospitals`

Proper use of **foreign keys**, **enums**, and **auto-incremented IDs** ensures integrity and scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (vanilla)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Hosting**: Localhost / XAMPP / Apache (configurable)
